I'd like to talk about my cousin, Li Hua. He's a software engineer, a few years older than me, and we both grew up in Shenzhen. He's a very clever and patient person.
The problem he solved was something he noticed in our local community. Many elderly people, like my own grandparents, were struggling to use their new smartphones. They wanted to video call their families or use messaging apps, but they found the interfaces too complicated and confusing. They felt a bit left behind by technology.
He solved it in a very clever way. First, he spent a few weekends at the community center, patiently teaching them the basics. But he realized they often forgot the steps. So, being a programmer, he decided to build a simple app. He used Python to create a tool with a very clean interface—just a few big, colorful buttons for functions like "Video Call" or "Send Message." It was like a shortcut that bypassed all the complicated menus. He even made paper guides with QR codes that linked to his app.
I think his method was smart for a few reasons. First, he didn't just give instructions; he created a lasting, practical tool. Second, he used his professional skills in a very kind and useful way. I remember seeing him help my grandma use it to call me when I was in my dorm in Dalian. . It showed me that smart problem-solving isn't just about complex code, but about understanding people's real needs and making their lives easier.
