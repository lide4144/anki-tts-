The app I'd like to talk about is CapCut. It's a video editing application that I use on my phone.
I use it quite often, probably several times a week. As a computer science student, I sometimes need to make short videos for my class projects, and this app is perfect for that.
I use it in two main situations. First, for my university work in Dalian. When I finish a project, I can use CapCut to make a simple presentation video. Second, and more importantly, I use it for personal reasons. I really miss my family in Shenzhen. So, sometimes I ask my parents to send me short clips of my grandparents. I then use this app to edit them into a nice little family video. It makes me feel closer to home.
I found this app about a year ago. I was searching online for a simple, user-friendly editing tool for a university assignment. Many people recommended it, so I downloaded it to try.
I feel really positive about it. It's incredibly useful and easy to learn. One time, I even decided to pay for some extra features, like better filters. I spent a bit more money than I first planned, but it was totally worth it. It helps me practice my skills and, more importantly, it helps me save and share precious family memories. So for me, it's much more than just an app.
