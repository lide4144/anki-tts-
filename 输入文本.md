I'd like to talk about my cousin, Li Hua. He's not just family, but also a very close friend. He's a few years older than me, and he works as a software engineer in Shenzhen, where we both grew up.
Recently, he learned how to play the guitar. He taught himself completely from scratch. I remember he started about two years ago. He bought his first guitar and just began practicing using online tutorials and apps.
The main reason he learned was for relaxation. His job as a programmer can be quite stressful, with long hours in front of the computer. He told me he wanted a hobby that was completely different, something creative and hands-on. He also loves music, so the guitar seemed like a perfect choice. I remember him saying he wanted to be able to play at our family gatherings.
I think for him, learning by himself was actually easier than learning from a teacher. He's a very independent and patient person. He could practice whenever he had free time, like late at night after work. He used apps that showed him chords and listened to songs slowly to figure out the notes. For his personality and busy schedule, this self-paced method worked really well. A fixed class with a teacher might have felt like more pressure. Now, he plays beautifully, and he even taught me a few basic chords last summer. It was a great way for us to connect, especially since I'm now studying in Dalian.
