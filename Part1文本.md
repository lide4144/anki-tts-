---
问题: 5.Do you know any of your neighbors?

Back home in Shenzhen, my family lives in an apartment in Futian, but it's a very busy area and people usually keep to themselves. I guess city life is like that sometimes—convenient, but not very close with neighbors.
---
问题: 6.Are the people in your neighborhood nice and friendly?
回答:
Yes, I think so. I grew up in Futian, Shenzhen, and my neighbors were mostly families like mine. We didn't talk a lot because everyone was busy, but they were always friendly.
